# Supabase Landing Page Rebuild 🧰

A clean, responsive clone of the official Supabase landing page — rebuilt from scratch as a learning exercise and demonstration of modern frontend practices.

## 🔎 What it is

This project recreates the core UI and layout of Supabase’s official marketing website (hero section, feature list, testimonials, “trusted by” logos, templates section, footer etc.) using standard web technologies. The goal is to mimic the look-and-feel of the original page while improving understanding of layout, responsiveness, and design patterns.
